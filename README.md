# ISTEX JAVA LIBRARY

## Presentation
This project is a JAVA driven library used to deal with documents corpora such as the [ISTEX](http://www.istex.fr/) one.

This library allows to handle large sparse matrices by using CSR and CSC formats.
It allows to analyse diachronically two different clustering of a same corpora (**[2]**) but at different time steps using several methods (**[1]**).
Furthermore, this tool is also adapted to deal with large weighted graphs to study the collaboration networks of authors of the corpus (**[3]**).

## Installation
* The Java project may be imported into all IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ or Netbeans) and then built. It need JRE7 at least ;
* It requires GSON library and apache common cli library to be included in the build path.

## Organization
The project is composed of the following folders:
* `CSR`: contains the main JAVA project
  * `src`: Java main class
  * `test`: Junit test of the program
  * `doc` : Html doc of the project
* `Expe_scientometrics` : contains data about the results from the JC paper, the report generated by JC and the report generated by the Java App.
* `Visu` : is about the javascript scripts used to visualise the diachronic report
